# THE CALL STACK

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

Manage function invocation (call): The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

What causes a stack overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

In summary
The key takeaways from the call stack are:

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

## JavaScript error messages && debugging

Types of error messages
The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message that the one we saw just moments ago, it usually appears on your console (being developer tools of the browser, terminal or whatever else you are using).
For those already used to programming, reading an error message is like second nature, for everybody else, is something you learn either you like it or not so might as well talk a bit about each of them.

## Debugging

To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).
If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

You can also add conditional breakpoints by right-clicking a previous set breakpoint, which will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met, this is awesome for when you want to debug huge cycles for specific values.

## Handling errors

About the light blue part of our earliest example of an error message, that shows up like that when we do not handle errors properly, meaning that anything after that error will not be executed. To avoid this we usually try to catch the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error (this fallback can be a 404 page which is normally not that graceful but is better than a page to just stop working).

## Tools to avoid runtime errors

JS is not a compiled language like Java so your errors will happen at runtime, that means that you can only see whatever is wrong with your code after your run it.
Thankfully, to save us quite some time you can use tools like:
quokka to evaluate your code as you type
eslint to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way and
For those of you looking to make JS a more strong typed experience you can check out stuff like TypeScript (like I said in a previous article, when learning I rather avoid libraries that abstract the core language so I wouldn’t recommend this last one when starting).

## Conclusion

Being able to read error messages and practising debugging is one of your biggest weapons has a developer, do it frequently and with enough time you will notice a great decrease in the time you spend on each error that you find along the way. And remember, before a commit/push, remove all the debugging stuff from your code, we don’t want the client or another developer to get stuck on a debugger now do we?
