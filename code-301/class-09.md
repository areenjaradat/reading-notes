# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions
how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

## Immutability

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

Functions as first-class entities

The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.
Functions as first-class entities can:
refer to it from constants and variables
pass it as a parameter to other functions
return it as result from other functions
ex:
const doubleSum = (a, b) => (a + b) * 2;

## Filter

Given a collection, we want to filter by an attribute. The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection. Basically, if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection. Otherwise, it will not.

## Map

The idea of map is to transform a collection.
The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

## Reduce
The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
