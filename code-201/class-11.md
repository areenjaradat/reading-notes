## Practical Information

Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

1. Page Title
2. URL/Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions

## Video and Audio APIs

The < video> and < audio> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed in Video and audio content, a typical implementation looks like this:

< video controls>
  < source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  < source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  < p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a < a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video< /a > instead.</ p>
< /video >

Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically â€” for example HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause(), etc. This interface is available to both < audio> and < video> elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical. Let's go through an example, adding features as we go.

The < video> element contains two < source> elements so that different formats can be loaded depending on the browser viewing the site.
