## list

### HTML provides three different types of list':'

1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered.

The ordered list is created with the '<'ol'>' element.

Each item in the list is placed between an opening '<'li'>' tag and a closing '<'/li'>' tag. (The li stands for list item.)

## Boxes

### this section on CSS

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

1. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

## SWITCH STATEMENTS

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

##### why we need  switch statment?

when we have a variable with more than one possible so instead of use a lot of if statments and else we can use switch statment.
