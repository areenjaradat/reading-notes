# A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it

## Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3. CODE EACH STEP

 Computers solve problems programmatically; they follow series of instructions, one after another. The type of instructions they need are often different to the type of instructions you might give to another human.

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash (-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. 
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create variables that have the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.

## CREATING AN ARRAY

You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of
the array).
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];

## VALUES IN ARRAYS

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

Each item in an array isautomatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the
array.

## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
Ex:var color = 'beige';

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.
var area = 3 * 2;
