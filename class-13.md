### USING HTML5 STORAGE

You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats.

there is many objects you can use to using storage like:
setItem(),getItem(),removeItem(),key().

### TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA

If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event.The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something
