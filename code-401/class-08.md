# Access Control (ACL)

When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

```The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret.
The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to authentication using an OAuth2 token. JWT authentication is the best choice as it is a token, but nothing prevents you from using a custom scheme.```

What does the JSON Web Token package do?

```JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.```


What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
```Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories
Avoid git add * commands on git
Add sensitive files in .gitignore
Don’t rely on code reviews to discover secrets
Use automated secrets scanning on repositories
Don’t share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like slack
Store secrets safely```


`encryption`can help protect data you send, receive, and store, using a device. That can include text messages stored on your smartphone, running logs saved on your fitness watch, and banking information sent through your online account.

`token` used in bearer authentication, a token is a cryptic string that is generated by the server in response to a login request

`JSON Web Token`
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
