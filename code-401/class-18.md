# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## What are serverless functions?

are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies. The engineering teams within those companies ensure that the serverless functions have near-perfect uptime, redundant instances around the world, and scale to any incoming network request volume.

## Describe how a CDN works

Over half of the internet’s traffic is served by a content delivery network (CDN). The goal of the CDN is to reduce latency – the delay between submitting a request for a web page and the web page fully loading on your device – by reducing the physical distance that the request has to travel.

## Term

`Serverless Functions`are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies. The engineering teams within those companies ensure that the serverless functions have near-perfect uptime, redundant instances around the world, and scale to any incoming network request volume.

`Cloud Storage`allows you to save data and files in an off-site location that you access either through the public internet or a dedicated private network connection.

`CDN`a content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

## AWS API Gateway Overview

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.

How does API Gateway work?
API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your API’s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation.

## AWS API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

## AWS DynamoDB

What is DynamoDB?
DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

reliable performance even as it scales;
a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.
DynamoDB is a particularly good fit for the following use cases:

Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements. As your amount of data scales, JOINs and advanced SQL operations can slow down your queries. With DynamoDB, your queries have predictable latency up to any size, including over 100 TBs!

Serverless applications using AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda provides auto-scaling, stateless, ephemeral compute in response to event triggers. DynamoDB is accessible via an HTTP API and performs authentication & authorization via IAM roles, making it a perfect fit for building Serverless applications.
