# OAuth

OAuth is "an open standard for access delegation" ... In other words, OAuth serves as a way to give users the ability to grant application access to services, without giving the application their password. Today, we will be giving our server the ability to "Login as You" at Google and other providers

How OAuth works?
OAuth allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password. Because the more you give away your password, the more you give away your passwords, the more likely it is that your passwords will get compromised.

OAuth uses a system of tokens. Called “access tokens”. An access token gives one third-party source temporary access to a limited amount of your personal information on another third-party source.
