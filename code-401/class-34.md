# `<Login/>` and `<Auth/>`

## Review, Research, and Discussion

  1. **Why is the Context API useful?** Context API is useful because it can help to make information globally available in the app rather than having to pass it in props to each individual child element.

  2. **Can a component outside of a provider get its context?** Yes, any component inside the app can get the context as long as it is passed properly and imported at the top of the target page.

  3. **What are some common use cases for using the Context API?** Needing to pass functions that need to be available in mutiple places.

  4. **Describe “Context Hell”** As far as I can find, it has to do with too many nested contexts.

## what is role based access control?

- It restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization
- You can designate management or employee roles that allow certain privileges.
- Having roles reduces administrative work, as a new employee can be assigned automatically by job title/function, and can decrease unneccessary access to sensitive information/documents.
