# How to Solve Programming Problems

You must resist this urge.
You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.
A simple set of steps
simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

**Read the problem completely twice**
This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.
If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

**Solve the problem manually**
It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.
**Optimize the manual solution**
People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.
It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.
**Write pseudo-code or comments**
Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.
If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.
What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.
**Replace comments with real code**
This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.
**Optimize the real code**
Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

if you placed a high value on your time, your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.
Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month. This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place. We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins:
The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.
For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters. Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

## How to think like a programmer

what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??
Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.
•Try a solution.
•If that doesn’t work, try another one.
•If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
The best way involves
•having a framework and practicing it.
oUnderstand : Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them, when you understand a problem is when you can explain it in plain English.
oPlan : Don’t dive right into solving without a plan it can help you if you write down the exact steps.Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
oDivide: Do not try to solve one big problem. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer). After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved. Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots. Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.
oStuck: Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. and Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach and Research: Google. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person solution.
oPractice: Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

## The 5 Whys

The 5 Whys technique is true to this tradition, and it is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the process or problem in question. The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking “Why?” five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring

- Assemble a Team
- Define the Problem
- Ask the First “Why?”
- Ask “Why?” Four More Times
- Know When to Stop
- Address the Root Cause(s)
- Monitor Your Measures
